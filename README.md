# Weather_Dashboard

A quick and easy-to-use tool to check the weather conditions in desired cities

## Motivation

This application allows a user to choose whatever city they desire and find out the weather conditions in said city for that day. It will allow the user to see not only current weather conditions, including temperature, wind speed, humidity, and UV index, but also a forecast of the weather for the following 5 days. After cities are searched for by the user, buttons will appear for the user to be able to retrieve the weather information for those past city searches at any time.
